## 2.1 Defining a Common Language for Sampling

1.  A **census** is an attempt to collect data from every member of the population, while a **sample survey** is a collection of data from a subset of the population chosen by the researcher. A **sample survey** is a type of **observational study**.

2.  **Sampling Unit**

    The individual person, animal, or object that has the measurement (observation) taken on them / it.

3.  **Population**

    The entire group of individuals or objects that we wish to know something about. A numerical characteristic of the population is called a **parameter**.

4.  **Sampling Frame**

    The list of the sampling units from which those to be contacted for inclusion in the sample is obtained. The sampling frame lies between the population and intended sample. Ideally, the sampling frame should match the population, but rarely does because the population is not usually small enough to list all members of the population.

5.  **Intended Sample**

    Those individuals or objects who are contacted or selected from the sampling frame to have the measurement taken.

5.  **Sample**

    Those individuals or objects who provide the data to be collected. Numerical characteristics of the sample are called **statistics** and are typically used as estimates of population parameters.

6.  The process

    You want to know about a **POPULATION** but you only really have access to a **SAMPLING FRAME** that you can draw an **INTENDED SAMPLE** from, but in the end, you only get observations from the actual **SAMPLE**.

7.  **Selection Bias**

    The sampling frame should be as close to the entire population as possible. If this is not possible, the sampling frame should appropriately represent the desired population. **Undercoverage** is a type of selection bias in which sampling frame leaves out major portions of the population.

8.  **Nonresponse Bias**

    Nonresponse bias arises from low response rate. This problem can create bias if the people who respond have different views than those who do not.
