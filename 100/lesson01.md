## 1.1 What is Statistics?

1.  Selection Bias
2.  Nonresponse Bias
3.  Comparative Study (true / false)
    - Observational Study (describe association)
    - Experiment / Randomized Experiment (cause and effect)
4.  Three Conditions to conduct a proper study:
    - Get a representative sample
    - Get a large enough sample
    - Decide whether the study should be an observational study or experiment.

## 1.2 Asking Research Questions

1.  Seven pitfalls when asking questions in a survey:
    - Deliberate Bias such as One-Sided Statements
    - Filtering
    - Importance of Order
    - Anchoring
    - Unintentional Bias

       People will tend to answer "oppose" or "no" to a question that contains words such as _forbid_, _control_, _ban_, _outlaw_, and _restrain_, regardless of what question is being asked. People do not like to be told that they cannot do something.

    - Unnecessary Complexity ("Double Barreled" Problem)
    - Asking the Uninformed and Unnecessary Complexity (Double Negative Problem and List Problem)


#### Inverse and Transpose

1. Matrix Inverse

   If $A$ is an $m\times m$ matrix (also called square matrix), and if it has an inverse,

   $$
   A{ A }^{ -1 }={ A }^{ -1 }A=1
   $$

   Matrices that don't have an inverse are sometimes called "singular" or "degenerate".

2. Matrix Transpose
