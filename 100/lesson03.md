## 3.1 Reviewing Studies - Getting the Big Picture

1.  **Step One**

    *Determine the type of study conducted (e.g. sample survey, prospective observational study, randomized experiment).*

2.  **Step Two**

    *Determine the critical components of the research.* Here you must seek answers to questions like who funded the research? Who were the subjects and how did they come to take part? What are the exact measurements made or questions asked? What was the research setting? What differences between comparison groups might exist besides the factor of interest? How big of an effect was seen and did the researchers claim it was statistically significant (unlikely to happen by chance)?

    Have a look at some examples and judge yourself whether understanding the critical components suggests potential sources of bias.

3.  **Step Three**

    *Check the "Difficulties and Disasters" that we saw in earlier lessons.*

    1. For sample surveys

       * Check if a probability method was used in generating the sample
       * Check if sampling frame was close to the population of interest
       * Check if there were difficulties in reaching certain parts of the sampling frame that could be related to what's being studied
       * Check the response rate and think about how non-respondents might differ from respondents

    2. For comparative observational studies

       * Check for possible confounding variables and whether claims of causation were made (ask: Is there an important factor related to what brought the subjects into groups being compared?)
       * Check whether claims about generalizing the results to a larger population are appropriate
       * Check whether a retrospective or prospective design was used (if retrospective - is there a reliance on the accuracy of a subject's memory?)

    3. For randomized experimental studies

       * Check for possible confounding variables when a small samples are used (with large samples the randomization will help with this)
       * Check for interacting variables (ask: Do the results stay the same for different sub-populations?)
       * Check for placebo, Hawthorne, and experimenter effects (ask: Was the experiment double-blind? Would subjects behave differently because they are being studied?)

4.  **Step Four**

    If the information needed to critique is not provided in the report, try to find the original source and see if the missing information is provided there.

5.  **Step Five**

    Do the results make sense? Are they based on sound scientific footing?

6.  **Step Six**

    Ask if there is an alternative explanation for the results?

7.  **Step Seven**

    Decide if the results are strong enough to encourage you to change your behavior or beliefs.
