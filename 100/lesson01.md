## 1.1 What is Statistics?

1.  Comparative Study (true / false)

    - Observational Study (describe association)
    - Experiment / Randomized Experiment (cause and effect)

2.  Three conditions to conduct a proper study:

    - Get a representative sample
    - Get a large enough sample
    - Decide whether the study should be an observational study or experiment.

## 1.2 Asking Research Questions

1.  Seven pitfalls when asking questions in a survey:
    - Deliberate Bias such as One-Sided Statements
    - Filtering
    - Importance of Order
    - Anchoring
    - Unintentional Bias

       People will tend to answer "oppose" or "no" to a question that contains words such as _forbid_, _control_, _ban_, _outlaw_, and _restrain_, regardless of what question is being asked. People do not like to be told that they cannot do something.

    - Unnecessary Complexity ("Double Barreled" Problem)
    - Asking the Uninformed and Unnecessary Complexity (Double Negative Problem and List Problem)

## 1.3 Defining a Common Language

1.  Observed Characteristics (Variables)
    - Categorical Variables
      - Nominal Variables

        e.g., hair color

      - Ordinal Variables

        Sorted in an order of rank value, e.g., agreement with a tax proposal (agree / neutral / disagree)

    - Measurement (Numerical) Variables
      - Discrete Variables

        e.g., number of siblings

      - Continuous Variables

        e.g., time since last meal

2.  Characteristics of a measure
    - Validity
    - Reliability
    - Bias
