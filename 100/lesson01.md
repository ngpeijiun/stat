## 1.1 What is Statistics?

1.  Selection Bias
2.  Nonresponse Bias
3.  Comparative Study (true / false)
    - Observational Study (describe association)
    - Experiment / Randomized Experiment (cause and effect)
4.  Three Conditions to conduct a proper study:
    - Get a representative sample
    - Get a large enough sample
    - Decide whether the study should be an observational study or experiment.

## 1.2 Asking Research Questions

1.  Seven pitfalls when asking questions in a survey:
    - Deliberate Bias such as One-Sided Statements
    - Filtering
    - Importance of Order
    - Anchoring
    - Unintentional Bias

       People will tend to answer "oppose" or "no" to a question that contains words such as _forbid_, _control_, _ban_, _outlaw_, and _restrain_, regardless of what question is being asked. People do not like to be told that they cannot do something.

    - Unnecessary Complexity ("Double Barreled" Problem)
    - Asking the Uninformed and Unnecessary Complexity (Double Negative Problem and List Problem)

## 1.3 Defining a Common Language

1. Observed Characteristics (Variables)
   - Categorical Variables
     - Nominal Variables

       e.g., hair color

     - Ordinal Variables

       Sorted in an order of rank value, e.g., agreement with a tax proposal (agree / neutral / disagree)

   - Measurement Variables (numerical)
     - Discrete Variables

       e.g., number of siblings

     - Continuous Variables

       e.g., time since last meal

#### Inverse and Transpose

1. Matrix Inverse

   If ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A) is an ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m%5Ctimes%20m) matrix (also called square matrix), and if it has an inverse,

   <p align="center"><img alt="equation" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A%7B%20A%20%7D%5E%7B%20-1%20%7D%3D%7B%20A%20%7D%5E%7B%20-1%20%7DA%3D1"></p>

   Matrices that don't have an inverse are sometimes called "singular" or "degenerate".

2. Matrix Transpose

   Let ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A) be an ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m%5Ctimes%20n) matrix, and let ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?B%20%3D%20%7B%20A%20%7D%5E%7B%20T%20%7D). Then ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?B) is an ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n%5Ctimes%20m) matrix, and

   <p align="center"><img alt="equation" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%7B%20B%20%7D_%7B%20ij%20%7D%3D%7B%20A%20%7D_%7B%20ji%20%7D"></p>
